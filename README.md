# Docker Workshop

This workshop will focus on a beginning to intermediate level of docker content and commands. It sets up a basic continous integration example using Jenkins spawned from a Docker Container. The tutorial does its best to bring the student along on the journey of implementing this and troubleshoots some common Docker issues along the way.
